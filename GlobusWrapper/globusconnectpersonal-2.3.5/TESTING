Things to test for each release:

Do the following both in the GUI and in the CLI:

1) starting with no .globusonline dir:
   a) run setup
   b) run connect
   c) verify that ls, transfers, and sharing work and match the default rp
      rules (rw~/)
   d) verify that .globusonline/lta/config-paths is created with default
   e) GUI only: change path config, verify that ls and transfer see the
      new rules, and that config-paths is updated

2) starting with existing .globusonline dir without config-paths, repeat (1)

3) starting with existing .globusonline dir and existing config-paths
   a) verify that it respects existing settings
   b) re-run setup and verify that it works with new ep but doesn't whipe
      config-paths


CLI only:

1) Run with -restrict-paths, verify that it ignores config-paths and only uses
   arg, and that sharing is not allowed at any path.

2) Run with -restrict-paths and -shared-paths, verify that sharing works only
   where specified.

3) Run -help and check:
    - accurate, easy to understand
    - good formatting
    - no abbreviations
    - no old names like globus online or globus connect sans personal

4) Run with -version, make sure is accurate.

5) Run on remote machine or VM without X windows.


GUI only:

1) check that version is correct in about dialog

2) run on machine or vm without tk, verify that friendly message is shown
(known issue: doesn't work with tk8.4, requires 8.5)

3) run on machine or vm without tcllib, verify that friendly message is shown

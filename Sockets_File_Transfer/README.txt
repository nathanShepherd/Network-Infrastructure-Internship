Example usage:
	Start Server via [./local]$ python3 server.py
	Start Client via [./local]$ python3 client.py
	
	Once a connection is established, 
		specify which file to be retrieved from ./local/server_files.
	Then the file will be retrieved using the server.
	File is sent to the client's local directory with "new_" added to filename.
